# OpenHAB Integration

OpenHAB can provide a frame work to convert the MQTT messages into a user friendly interface. It can also provide automation functionality.

These files allow Openhab to connect to the MQTT data.

* 'Things' defines the MQTT messages to interact with
* 'items' defines variables that connect to the 'things'.
* 'rules' defines scripts to provide automation
* 'sitemap' defines the human interface
